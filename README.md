### RANKING SYSTEM!! BE AWARE!!
- Keyword Weighting: Assign different weights to different keywords or keyword combinations based on their relevance or importance. For example, if certain keywords are more crucial to the question, you might want to give them higher weights.
- Exact Match Bonus: Give a higher score for exact keyword matches. You could provide extra points if the entire user question matches a keyword or keyword combination exactly.
- Proximity Match: Consider giving higher scores if the keywords are close to each other in the user's question. For example, if the keywords appear within a certain number of words from each other.
- Contextual Analysis: Analyze the context of the question to determine the relevance of the keywords. You could use natural language processing techniques to understand the context and relationships between words.
- Synonyms and Variants: Include synonyms or variants of keywords in your analysis. This might involve expanding your keyword database to include synonyms that users might use in their questions.
- Frequency Analysis: Count the frequency of each keyword or keyword combination in the question. You could assign higher scores to questions where the most relevant keywords are mentioned multiple times.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of the question and the answer to provide more relevant responses. For example, if the user's question is negative in tone, you might want to provide a more empathetic response.
- User History: If you have access to user history, you could take into account previous interactions and preferences to tailor the ranking.
- User Intent: Try to understand the user's intent behind the question. This can involve more advanced natural language processing techniques to determine the purpose of the question.
- Machine Learning: Consider using machine learning techniques to learn from user interactions and improve the ranking over time.
