The game places the player in the fictional post-Soviet Republic of Chernarus, the original setting of ARMA 2, where a mysterious plague has turned most of the population into violent infected. As a survivor, the player must scavenge the world for food, water, weapons and medicine, while killing or avoiding the infected, and killing, avoiding, or cooperating with other players in an effort to survive the outbreak. DayZ began development in 2012 when the mod's creator, Dean Hall, joined Bohemia Interactive to commence work on the standalone version of the game. The development has been focused on altering the engine to suit the game's needs, developing a working client-server architecture, and introducing new features like diseases and a better inventory system. The game sold over three million copies during its early access phase."
